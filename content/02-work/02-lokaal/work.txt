Copy01: When an entrepreneur and coffee-aficionado approached us a couple of years ago to create his espresso-bar in the center of our hometown we couldn’t refuse. The deal was simple: “you worry about making sure your coffee is the best brew in town, we’ll do the rest”

Weaponofchoice was responsible for all interior design and branding. The building is underneath an old railway line, close to where once stood the pre-war majestic central station of Rotterdam. We wanted to revive the classical canteen atmosphere of the old stations of Europe. The concept is simple, a very minimal design, executed in very warm and high quality materials like brass and classical pine-wood.

No high-end canteen can survive without a great menu and impressive business cards, all printed on smooth paper and of course not without gold foil embossing.
